# ReSounder
ReSounder lets you turn spectrogram pictures back into sound. It reads common visual styles, including different color maps and frequency scales like linear, log, mel, and bark. It also works to rebuild the missing phase information so the audio sounds more natural. It is useful for anyone who wants to recover or experiment with sound from spectrogram images.
